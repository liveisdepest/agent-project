Based on the detailed analysis of your project (Smart Agriculture MCP System / FarmMind Agent), I have prepared a comprehensive draft for your project paper.

The paper is titled **"FarmMind: An LLM-Driven Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Agricultural Decision-Making and Control based on Model Context Protocol"**.

It covers the following key sections:
1.  **Abstract**: Summarizes the system's ability to integrate environmental sensing, weather data, and online knowledge for precise irrigation.
2.  **Introduction**: Highlights the limitations of traditional IoT and the potential of LLM + MCP.
3.  **System Architecture**: Details the Orchestrator-Perception-Reasoning-Action pattern.
4.  **Key Technologies**: Explains MCP, `browser-use` integration, and the decision algorithm.
5.  **System Implementation**: Describes the hardware (ESP8266) and software (FastAPI, WebSocket) stack.
6.  **Case Study**: Demonstrates a typical workflow (Wheat irrigation decision).
7.  **Conclusion**: Summarizes contributions and future directions.

I will present the full text of the draft in the next message.
